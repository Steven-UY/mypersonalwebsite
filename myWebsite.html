        <h2>Basic Introduction</h2>
        <p> 
            My name is Steven Uy and I am a freshman at Fordham University. I am from the Philippines and I am majoring in Computer Science. I love to go to the gym, watch anime, play video games, explore the city, edit videos, watch basketball and football (soccer), eat good food and spend quality time with family and friends.
        <br></br>
            I really enjoyed watching the <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022" target="_blank">World Cup</a>. I am extremely happy with Messi winning the World Cup since he's the best to ever do it and he deserved that World Cup. The final was also the greatest match of football (soccer) that I've seen in my life.

            In terms of anime, I'm currently watching one called <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/49596/Blue_Lock">Blue Lock</a>. Funnily enough, it's also about football and it centers around Japan trying to find the perfect "Striker" to help them win the World Cup. My favourite character is Bachira since he's a very flashy dribbler and he just has a cool character design as well.
